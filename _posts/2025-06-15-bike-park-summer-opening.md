When the snow melts, the mountain takes on a whole new character. Bike Park Czarna Góra has opened for the summer season, transforming ski slopes into an extensive network of mountain biking trails that cater to everyone from cautious beginners to adrenaline-seeking experts.

## Trail Diversity

The park boasts an impressive 19 trails spread across the mountain, each offering distinct challenges and experiences:

**Beginner-Friendly Routes**
Newcomers and recreational riders can build confidence on gentle trails designed for skill development. These paths provide a safe introduction to mountain biking while still delivering scenic mountain views.

**Advanced Downhill Challenges**
Experienced riders tackle technical descents featuring steep gradients, tight corners, and demanding terrain that tests both skill and nerve.

## New Training Facilities

Two specialized arenas have been introduced to help riders develop their abilities:

**Kids Arena**
Specifically designed for young cyclists, this area nurtures a love for mountain biking in a controlled, age-appropriate environment.

**Skills Arena**
Featuring winding descents and strategic obstacle courses, this training ground allows riders of all levels to practice specific techniques and build confidence.

## Bike Academy Programs

A major highlight of the 2025 season is the launch of the comprehensive Bike Academy, offering structured learning opportunities for children aged 7 and above:

- **Summer camps** priced at 3,250 PLN, running throughout June, July, and August
- **Focused training sessions** at 1,800 PLN for targeted skill development
- Multiple session dates to accommodate various schedules

## Professional Instruction and Equipment

The Arek Bike Center serves as the hub for serious mountain bikers, led by Arkadiusz Perin - a former Olympic athlete and Polish national team coach. The center offers:

- Individual and group instruction across all mountain biking disciplines (downhill, freeride, enduro, XCO)
- Weekend training sessions and multi-day camps
- A retail shop stocking premium brands like Fox Head and EVOC

## NS Bikes Equipment Rental

Located in the Czarna Perła building near the Efka lift, the rental center provides top-quality NS Bikes equipment including:
- Children's bikes sized appropriately for young riders
- Enduro bikes for all-mountain adventures
- Downhill bikes for gravity-focused riding

## Monsterroller Adventure

For something completely different, the park now features Monsterroller - all-terrain scooters with three dedicated courses suitable for riders aged 10 and up. It's a fun alternative for those who want wheeled mountain excitement without the commitment of mountain biking.

## Seasonal Schedule

The Bike Park operates daily from 9 AM to 6 PM throughout the summer months. Spring and autumn see weekend-only operations (Friday through Sunday) with slightly reduced hours depending on daylight availability.

Whether you're taking your first tentative pedal strokes down a mountain trail or seeking technical challenges that push your limits, Bike Park Czarna Góra delivers an exceptional two-wheeled mountain experience.
