Welcome to this example blogpost. This content is provided so you can see how posts will render
using the site's theme and the `posts` layout.

## What this example demonstrates

- How to structure a post file in `_posts`.
- Front matter fields: `title`, `date`, `author`, `categories`, `tags`, `excerpt`.
- Markdown content rendering via the site's templates and includes.

## Example content

This paragraph is an example of normal post content. You can include lists, code, images, and
other markdown features.

> Tip: Add more posts under `_posts/` and they will automatically appear on the `/blog/` page grouped by year.

### Small code example

```ruby
# This is just an example code block
def hello
  puts "Hello from the blog post!"
end
```

Thanks for trying the blog feature — feel free to edit this file or add more posts.
