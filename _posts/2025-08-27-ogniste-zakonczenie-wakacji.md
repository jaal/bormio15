As summer winds down, Czarna Góra Resort is preparing a memorable finale that combines mountain beauty with mesmerizing entertainment. On August 30th, visitors are invited to witness a stunning fire dance performance at the summit - a perfect way to celebrate the season's end.

## An Evening to Remember

The event is carefully choreographed to showcase both the natural beauty of the mountains and the artistry of professional fire dancers from Singularity Circus. Here's how the evening unfolds:

**7:00 PM - Evening Begins**
The festivities kick off at Karczma Czarna Góra with a cozy bonfire, grilled treats, and warm beverages to set the mood.

**8:00-9:00 PM - Sunset Ascent**
Guests board the Luxtorpeda cable car for a scenic ride to the mountain peak, perfectly timed to catch the sunset over the Sudetes.

**9:00-9:30 PM - Fire Dance Performance**
The main event features Singularity Circus performing their captivating fire dance routine against the backdrop of the mountain night sky.

**9:30-10:00 PM - Return Journey**
After the show, the Luxtorpeda cable car brings everyone safely back down the mountain.

## Practical Information

The event itself is free to attend - visitors only need to purchase cable car tickets for the ascent and descent. Tickets can be bought:
- At the ticket office from 7:00 PM onwards on the day of the event
- During regular operating hours (9:00 AM - 6:00 PM) for use during the evening

## Weather Considerations

As with any mountain event, weather plays a crucial role. The resort notes that adverse conditions may necessitate relocating the performance or, in extreme cases, canceling it altogether. Check with the resort closer to the date for the latest updates.

## Beyond Summer

While this event marks the end of the main summer season, Czarna Góra Resort continues to welcome visitors on weekends throughout September. Hiking trails, biking paths, and stunning mountain vistas remain accessible for those seeking autumn adventures.
