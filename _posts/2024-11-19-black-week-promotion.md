Black Friday shopping isn't just for electronics and clothing anymore. Czarna Góra Resort is bringing the tradition to the slopes with an exciting Black Week campaign that combines substantial savings with an enticing giveaway.

## The Promotion Details

Running from November 22 through December 1, 2024, this Black Week event offers ski passes with discounts reaching up to 30% off regular prices. But the savings are just the beginning.

## Win Premium Fitness Technology

Every pass purchase during the promotional period automatically enters buyers into a contest for one of 50 Watchmark smartwatches. The prize pool includes:

- **GPS-enabled models** featuring water resistance and over 100 sports tracking modes
- **Cardio One models** specifically designed for fitness monitoring and heart rate tracking

These aren't token prizes - they're high-quality wearables that complement an active mountain lifestyle perfectly.

## How to Enter

The entry process is refreshingly simple:

1. Visit sklep.czarnagora.pl and purchase your ski pass during the promotional window
2. In the order notes section, answer the question: "What at Czarna makes your heart beat faster?"
3. That's it - you're automatically entered

## Perfect Timing

The resort notes that snow has already blanketed the mountain, and artificial snowmaking operations are in full swing. This means early-season conditions are shaping up nicely for those eager to hit the slopes as soon as the season officially opens.

## Year-Round Mountain Destination

Located in Poland's Clean Air Zone, Czarna Góra operates as a true four-season resort. While winter brings skiing and snowboarding, the warmer months offer hiking, biking, and countless other mountain activities.

## Terms and Conditions

Complete promotion rules and regulations are available on the resort's website for those who want to review all the fine print before participating.

This Black Week promotion represents excellent value for winter sports enthusiasts - combining immediate savings with the possibility of winning premium fitness technology. If you've been contemplating a season pass or planning a ski trip, this might be the perfect time to commit.
