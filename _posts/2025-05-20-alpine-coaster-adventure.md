Not all mountain thrills require athletic prowess or specialized skills. The Alpine Coaster Czarna Żmija (Black Viper) offers heart-pounding excitement that's accessible to virtually everyone - from young children with their guardians to thrill-seeking adults.

## Record-Breaking Track

Holding the distinction of being Poland's longest two-person alpine coaster, the Czarna Żmija stretches for an impressive 950 meters of continuous excitement. The track winds through diverse terrain, offering riders a unique perspective on the mountain landscape.

## The Ride Experience

Imagine boarding a brightly colored cart with a companion, securing your seatbelt, and then surrendering to gravity as you:

- **Race at speeds approaching 40 km/h** through carefully engineered curves
- **Navigate three distinct loops** that add an extra dimension to the descent
- **Glide through forest canopy** on sections that feel like flying between the trees
- **Cross a scenic viaduct** spanning a mountain stream

The beauty of the alpine coaster is its simplicity - riders control their own speed using a simple braking system, allowing for customized intensity levels on each run.

## Who Can Ride

The coaster accommodates a wide range of ages and abilities:
- Adults and teenagers can ride solo or paired
- Children under 8 years must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian
- Riders simply board, buckle up, and enjoy - no special skills required

## Year-Round Operation

Unlike many mountain attractions that close during certain seasons, the Czarna Żmija operates year-round, weather permitting. This makes it an excellent option for:
- Summer visitors seeking excitement beyond hiking
- Autumn travelers enjoying the colorful foliage
- Winter guests looking for non-skiing activities
- Spring adventurers welcoming the mountain's awakening

## Practical Considerations

While the coaster itself is straightforward, here are some helpful details:

**Pricing**: Current rates are available through the resort's price calculator at czarnagora.pl/sprawdz-cene/ or by contacting the resort directly at +48 74 306 76 01 or biuro@czarnagora.pl.

**Other Attractions**: The coaster is part of a larger Fun Park complex, so visitors seeking additional thrills will find plenty of other activities nearby.

## A Different Kind of Mountain Experience

For many visitors, traditional mountain activities like skiing or hiking present barriers - physical limitations, skill requirements, or weather dependencies. The Alpine Coaster democratizes mountain excitement, offering memorable thrills without demanding expertise or perfect conditions.

Whether you're seeking a family bonding experience, a unique date activity, or simply a break from more demanding mountain pursuits, the Czarna Żmija delivers 950 meters of pure joy. Just remember to bring your sense of adventure - and maybe a camera for the spectacular views between the adrenaline rushes.
