Winter enthusiasts, mark your calendars! The pre-sale season for the 2025/26 winter has officially kicked off, bringing some of the most attractive pricing we've seen for multi-day ski passes.

## Unbeatable Pre-Sale Pricing

Czarna Góra Resort has opened its doors to early-bird skiers with an impressive 30% discount across various pass options. This first phase of their pre-sale campaign offers what they're calling "the lowest season prices" on multi-day passes.

The promotion runs throughout September, though savvy shoppers should note that availability is limited to promotional inventory - once it's gone, it's gone.

## Flexible Options for Every Skier

The pre-sale includes several pass configurations to match different skiing styles:

- **Multi-day passes**: Choose from 2 to 6 consecutive days at reduced rates
- **Intensive day passes**: 7-hour sessions for those who want to maximize their slope time
- **Flexible 6-day pass**: A new "ski when you want" option that doesn't require consecutive days
- **Full seasonal pass**: Available exclusively during this pre-sale period

## World-Class Facilities

The resort continues to impress with 60 hectares of carefully maintained slopes, 20 distinct runs suitable for all abilities, and 12 modern lifts ensuring minimal wait times. Professional ski instruction is available, and the resort offers comprehensive amenities including accommodation, dining venues, and equipment rental services.

## How to Purchase

Passes are available now through the resort's dedicated shop at sklep.czarnagora.pl. For inquiries, you can reach the resort at +48 74 306 76 01 or via email at biuro@czarnagora.pl.

Don't miss this opportunity to lock in the season's best rates before the promotional inventory runs out!
