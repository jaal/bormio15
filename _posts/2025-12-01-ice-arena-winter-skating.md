Not everyone finds their winter joy on ski slopes. For those who prefer the graceful glide of blades on ice, Czarna Góra Resort has introduced a stunning new Ice Arena that transforms winter recreation into an elegant alternative to downhill skiing.

## Impressive Scale and Setting

The newly opened Ice Arena Czarna Góra features 800 square meters of genuine ice surface - not synthetic or plastic, but real frozen water that provides authentic skating conditions. The facility sits in a picturesque location near the Efka and Czarna Perła ski lifts, surrounded by the natural beauty of the Sudety mountains.

## Inclusive Pricing

One of the arena's most appealing features is its all-inclusive approach to pricing. Admission includes skate rental, eliminating the need for visitors to own or transport their own equipment. This thoughtful touch makes ice skating accessible to:
- Tourists who don't want to pack bulky skates
- Families trying skating for the first time
- Locals who enjoy occasional skating without the equipment investment

## No Experience Required

The Ice Arena embraces skaters of all abilities with open arms. As the resort emphasizes, whether you're a confident skater or taking your first tentative steps on ice, the focus is on enjoyment and shared laughter rather than performance or skill.

This philosophy creates a welcoming atmosphere where:
- Beginners feel comfortable learning without judgment
- Families can enjoy quality time together regardless of varying skill levels
- Experienced skaters can relish the simple pleasure of gliding on quality ice

## Perfect for Groups and Families

The arena's generous size and inclusive atmosphere make it ideal for social skating experiences. Groups of friends can spend hours on the ice, while families find it's a rare activity where everyone from grandparents to young children can participate together.

## Operating Details

The Ice Arena operates as part of the resort's winter season schedule. While specific hours may vary, the resort typically maintains extended operating hours during peak winter months - often from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM during busy periods.

For current pricing information, visitors can check the resort's online price calculator at czarnagora.pl/sprawdz-cene/.

## A Welcome Alternative

Ski resorts sometimes feel exclusive to those comfortable with skiing and snowboarding. The Ice Arena broadens the resort's appeal, ensuring that visitors who prefer ice to snow still have access to premium winter recreation in a spectacular mountain setting.

## The Complete Winter Experience

The arena positions itself not as an afterthought or secondary attraction, but as a legitimate centerpiece of the winter experience. Combined with the resort's other offerings - the Alpine Coaster, mountain views, dining options, and traditional ski facilities - it contributes to a truly comprehensive winter destination.

Whether you're seeking a romantic evening glide under the stars, a fun family afternoon, or simply a peaceful solo session working on your figure eights, the Ice Arena Czarna Góra delivers mountain winter magic without the need for skis.
